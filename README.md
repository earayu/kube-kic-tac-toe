# kube-kic-tac-toe
A TicTacToe Game based on Kubernetes Operator. This is a sample project to demonstrate how to build a Kubernetes Operator with Kubebuilder.

## Description
Please make sure kubernetes cluster is running and kubectl is configured properly.
```zsh
# build the CRDs and controller, and install CRDs into the kubernetes cluster
make manifests && make generate && make install
# run the controller
make run
# create a TicTacToe CRD, which will create a game
kubectl apply -f config/samples/test/tictactoe-game.yaml
# create a Move CRD, which will make a move in the game
kubectl apply -f config/samples/test/move1.yaml
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kube-kic-tac-toe:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kube-kic-tac-toe:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
